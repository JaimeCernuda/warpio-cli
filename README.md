Warpio CLI is a command-line AI workflow tool, specialized for scientific computing and HPC workflows as part of the [IOWarp project](httpshttps://grc.iit.edu/research/projects/iowarp). This command-line AI workflow tool connects to your tools, understands your code and accelerates your scientific workflows.

With Warpio CLI you can:

- Chat with AI models from your terminal
- Read, create, edit, and manipulate files in your codebase
- Get help with your scientific computing tasks and HPC workflows
- Run shell commands through an AI assistant
- Access specialized IOWarp agents for data analysis and I/O optimization

## Quick start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @warpio/warpio-cli
```

### Run

```bash
warpio
```

You can also run a one-off command using the `-p` or `--prompt` flag:

```bash
warpio -p "help me analyze this HDF5 file structure"
```

### Authentication

On the first run, Warpio will guide you through the authentication process. You will need to have your credentials ready for the services you intend to use.
